The Finance module provides a comprehensive overview of personal financial data. It connects to banks via Open Finance and services like Pluggy to automatically synchronize accounts, balances, and transactions. It includes features for automated expense categorization, data export to CSV/Excel for detailed analysis, and proactive payment reminders to help users stay on top of their bills.
